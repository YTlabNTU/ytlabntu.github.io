        "Abstract Note": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Over the last decades, several approaches have been proposed in the literature to incorporate users' perceptions of travel costs, their bounded rationality, and risk\u2010taking behaviors into network equilibrium modeling for traffic assignment problem. While theoretically advanced, these models often suffer from high complexity and computational cost and often involve parameters that are difficult to estimate. This study proposes an alternative approach where users' imprecise perceptions of travel times are endogenously constructed as fuzzy sets based on the probability distributions of random link travel times. Two decision rules are proposed accordingly to account for users' heterogeneous risk\u2010taking behaviors, that is, optimistic and pessimistic rules. The proposed approach, namely, the multiclass fuzzy user equilibrium, can be formulated as a link\u2010based variational inequality model. The model can be solved efficiently, and parameters involved can be either easily estimated or treated as factors for calibration against observed traffic flow data. Numerical examples show that the proposed model can be solved efficiently even for a large\u2010scale network of Mashhad, Iran, with 2538 links and 7157 origin\u2013destination pairs. The example also illustrates the calibration capability of the proposed model, highlighting that the model is able to produce much more accurate flow estimates compared with the Wardropian user equilibrium model.

        "Abstract Note": "<jats:p>Until the late-nineteenth century fire safety was considered the greatest problem in Finnish wooden towns. At first, masonry buildings were believed to be the solution and greater spaciousness was emphasized for aesthetic reasons. Later, spaciousness was recognized as improving fire safety. The practical goal was to extinguish fires; only later came fire protection through the creation of openings in the urban fabric that were wide enough to prevent fire from spreading. In the first phase streets were widened. In the late-eighteenth century there arose a need to diminish the likelihood of fires and also for experimentation with new methods of making urban structures more spacious. The first fire alleys were planned in the new town of Kuopio. They were an attempt to create in the street-block interior public or semi-public space. In old towns the only feasible solution was narrow fire alleys. They could not prevent fire from spreading, but they made it possible to penetrate into seats of fire in the street-block interior. A new street-block type emerged when the idea of fire alleys was combined with the awareness that deciduous trees could slow down or even stop a fire: one side of the plot was left without buildings to make it possible to plant deciduous trees. In its final form the street block was proposed by the inhabitants and can be regarded as a Finnish invention.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract Note": "<jats:p> The smartphone has become nearly indispensable in people\u2019s daily lives. Prevalent smartphone usage can be observed on various occasions, even during walking. However, pedestrians\u2019 perception of their surroundings may decline because they are absorbed by using the smartphone. The behavior of pedestrians using smartphones while walking at transit stations can be viewed as disturbance to pedestrian flows, thereby reducing the efficiency of station operation or even creating safety problems. This study seeks to describe such behavioral features mathematically and provide relevant implications for transit station design. Based on the social force model, the parameters reflecting the effect of smartphone usage on the perceived driving and repulsive forces are added and calibrated. By extracting trajectory data from the videos filmed in the field, the genetic algorithm is employed for the calibration process to minimize the gaps between the actual and projected trajectories. Two sets of parameter settings, for pedestrians with and without using smartphones, are determined and further applied to microscopic pedestrian simulation for a transfer station of the metro system in Taipei, Taiwan. The results indicate that pedestrians using smartphones are more prone to being affected by other pedestrians, revealing that their velocities are relatively unstable, while they need longer relaxation time to attain their desired walking statuses. The simulation results also visualize the potential bottlenecks in the station, where smartphone users may become obstacles to other pedestrians and increase the congestion level, highlighting the importance of incorporating the behavior modeling of pedestrians using smartphones into transit station design. </jats:p>",

        "Abstract Note": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>This study seeks to online calibrate the parameters of aggregate evacuee behavior models used in a behavior\u2010consistent information\u2010based control module for determining information strategies for real\u2010time evacuation operations. It enables the deployment of an operational framework for mass evacuation that integrates three aspects underlying an evacuation operation: demand (evacuee behavior), supply (network management), and disaster characteristics. To attain behavior\u2010consistency, the control module factors evacuees' likely responses to the disseminated information in determining information\u2010based control strategies. Hence, the ability of the behavior models to predict evacuees' likely responses is critical to the effectiveness of traffic routing by information strategies. The mixed logit structure is used for the aggregate behavior models to accommodate the behavioral heterogeneity across the population. An online calibration problem is proposed to calibrate the random parameters in the behavior models by using the least square estimator to minimize the gap between the predicted network flows and unfolding traffic dynamics. Background traffic, an important but rarely studied issue for modeling evacuation traffic, is also accounted for in the proposed problem. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the importance of the calibration problem for addressing the system consistency issues and integrating the demand, supply, and disaster characteristics for more efficient evacuation operations.

        "Abstract Note": "<jats:p> Intercity railway system operation on national holidays can be challenging because of possible surging demand. This study proposes an analysis framework to investigate railway system ridership data on national holidays, seeking to attain better understanding of relevant intercity trip patterns, so as to enable enhanced preparation and response before and during national holidays. The ridership data are analyzed in the form of Origin\u2013Destination (O-D) tables and regarded as pictures of N\u2009\u00d7\u2009 N pixels, where N is the number of the considered stations/cities in a railway system. The framework primarily adopts a deep auto-encoder to process these pictures to reduce data dimensions and abstracting key features within these pictorial data. Based on the abstracted features, k-means clustering is then conducted to categorize the O-D tables with similar trip patterns into the same group. Further, a discrete outcome model based on logistic regression is developed on the clustering results to enhance the interpretation of the trip pattern in each group and identify the significant holiday-related characteristics and external factors that can affect the trip pattern generation. The ridership data of Taiwan Railways Administration associated with 38 national holidays from January 2014 to August 2018 are analyzed. The analysis results highlight insightful interpretation in relation to clustered trip patterns and relevant trip characterization relative to various national holidays. The proposed framework and developed discrete outcome model are also validated, showing 85% correct assignments of O-D tables to the groups of relevant trip patterns. </jats:p>",

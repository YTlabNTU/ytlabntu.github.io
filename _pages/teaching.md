    <h3>CIE7021 Urban Transportation Planning</h3>
    <p>Transportation planning is the fundamental step for transportation-related construction and policy making. This course aims to inculcate the students with the underlying concept of the planning process to address the complexity of transportation systems. We will focus on travel demand modeling, while a broader context of demand-supply interaction will be discussed as well. The course covers both the traditional (popularly used) approaches and the challenges for transportation engineers nowadays, which involve the perspectives of social and environmental concerns. In addition to the planning process, operational and managerial contexts of a transportation system are further clarified and discussed. By the end of this course, the students should be equipped with theoretical understanding of the important issues in transportation planning and be capable of practically dealing with relevant real-world problems in a holistic and integrated manner.</p> 
    <p>This course is highly discussion-oriented. Class participation is strongly recommended (required).</p>

    <h3>CIE5104 Traveler Behavior Analysis</h3>
    <p>This course will discuss traveler behavior within and relative to transportation systems. One major focus is to read behavioral patterns from data using a variety of econometric tools and understand the relevant theories and mathematics. This course will also explore the cognitive process for travel decision-making at the level of psychological analysis, ultimately seeking to derive its implications in the planning, design, and operation of a transportation system.</p>
    <p>This course is highly discussion-oriented. Class participation is strongly recommended and required.</p>
    <p>Traveler behavior is the fundamental issue for analyzing the performance of a transportation system. Through this course, students will learn the econometric approaches to develop behavior models describing how travelers may behave within a transportation system and how they may evaluate the associated transportation services. Such capability involves the basic understanding of how people behave within transportation systems and relative to their characteristics, principles of questionnaire design, and the mathematic and statistic properties of different models. This course also aims to explore the psychology and cognitive process in travelers’ minds, which enables more detailed and more precise interpretation of traveler behavior. Further, students will be trained to think, to analyze and to criticize existing problems and models during in-class discussion and presentation, which can help them build the proficiency to face future challenges.</p>

    <h3>CIE2013 Transportation Engineering</h3>
    <p>Understanding the framework of traffic system analysis and the process of traffic planning, we study the traffic behavior model, traffic network equilibrium, and traffic flow model that are representative of mathematical analysis methods. Through exercises and presentations, we examine how these methodologies can be applied to the description of transportation phenomena.</p>
    <p>The aim is to learn specific methods of traffic system management and demand management, and to gain a comprehensive understanding of how to approach various traffic problems through traffic space design and system operation, etc.</p>

## Ongoing Courses

### CIE3025 Engineering Economics 

This course aims to inculcate the students with the underlying concept of economics and engineering process. Moreover, financial aspects and cost-benefit analysis over the lifecycle of an engineering project will be emphasized. By the end of this semester, the students should be equipped with an understanding of the economic facets of engineering projects and the analysis capability of relevant decisions. More specifically, the students should be able to read the balance sheet, annual report, and associated financial statements, ultimately developing the proficiency in the evaluation of engineering proposals in terms of their financial benefits in a holistic and systematic manner.

This course is highly discussion-oriented. Class participation is strongly recommended and required.
